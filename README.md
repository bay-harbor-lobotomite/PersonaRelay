# PersonaRelay üé≠

**Your Authentic AI Ghostwriter for the Decentralized Web.**

## Summary

PersonaRelay is a sophisticated social media automation platform designed for creators, developers, and brands who want to maintain a powerful and authentic presence on decentralized networks like Nostr.

In a world demanding constant content, it's easy to lose your unique voice. PersonaRelay solves this by not just generating text, but by first understanding your **digital voiceprint**. Using the **IO Intelligence API and Agents SDK**, it analyzes your writing style to create a rich AI Persona. This persona then becomes your AI ghostwriter, crafting on-brand content from simple prompts.

With an intuitive drag-and-drop calendar, robust background scheduling, and a polished, animated UI, PersonaRelay transforms content strategy from a chore into a seamless, automated, and genuinely authentic experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.10 or later)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and Docker Compose (for running Redis)
*   A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bay-harbor-lobotomite/PersonaRelay.git
cd PersonaRelay
```
#### 2. Backend Setup (/api directory)
The backend runs the FastAPI server, the Celery task scheduler, and Redis.
1) **Navigate to the backend directory**
```bash
cd api
```
2) **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3) **Install Python dependencies:**
(Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your backend folder)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Create an environment file similar to the one in ```.env.example.```  
5) **Start the services (3 separate terminals):**  
    
    - **Terminal 1: Start Redis using Docker:**  
     ```bash
        docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
     ```
    
    - **Terminal 2: Start the Celery worker:**
     ```bash
        celery -A celery_worker.celery_app worker --loglevel=info -P gevent
     ```    
    
    - **Terminal 3: Start the FastAPI server:**
     ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
      ```
    
Your backend should now be running on http://localhost:8000.

#### 3. Frontend Setup (/frontend directory)
The frontend is a Next.js app
1) **Navigate to the frontend directory (from the root)**
```bash
cd frontend
```
2) **Install Node.js dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
3) **Run the Next.js development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your frontend application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000. Open it in your browser and start creating posts.
